# CHOCOLATE-SALES-REPORT# Chocolate Sales Report Analysis

## Project Overview

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of chocolate sales data, offering insights into sales performance across various dimensions such as salespersons, products, countries, and over time. The goal of this report is to empower stakeholders with actionable insights to understand sales trends, identify top-performing areas, and make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies.

## Data Sources

The report is built upon sales transaction data. The primary data source contains information on:
* Sales Amount
* Boxes Shipped
* Product Details
* Sales Person Information
* Country
* Transaction Date

*(If your data source is an external file like an Excel or CSV, you can specify its location or include it in the repo if it's small and anonymized. If it's a database, explain how to connect.)*

## Report Pages & Key Insights

The report is currently structured into one main page (`Page 1` in the screenshot) which provides the following key visualizations:

1.  **Sales Performance by Sales Person:**
    * A column chart showing the `Sum of Amount` and `Sum of Boxes Shipped` for each sales person. This helps in identifying individual sales effectiveness.

2.  **Sales Distribution by Product:**
    * A pie chart illustrating the `Sum of Amount` for different chocolate products. This helps in understanding which products contribute most to overall sales.

3.  **Sales Volume by Country:**
    * A column chart depicting the `Sum of Boxes Shipped` by country. This highlights geographical sales strengths and areas for potential growth.

4.  **Sales Trend Over Time:**
    * A line chart displaying the `Sum of Boxes Shipped` by Year, Quarter, and Month. This visualization is crucial for identifying seasonal trends, growth patterns, or declines in sales over time.
